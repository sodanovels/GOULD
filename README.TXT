II. Installing Necessary Files and Drivers from the CD-ROM to your Hard Drive

A. Windows
1. Insert the Glenn Gould: The New Listener CD into your CD-ROM drive.
2. Double-click My Computer and open up the CD-ROM drive (commonly labelled as 
the D: drive). Inside you'll find a program called Setup.exe. Double-click 
Setup.exe to install the necessary programs and files onto your computer's hard 
drive.

B. Macintosh
1. Switch off Virtual Memory in the Memory folder of your Control Panels. You 
will have to restart your computer after turning off Virtual Memory.
2. The New Listener requires 10 MB of available RAM. To make more RAM available, 
you can turn off any unnecessary Extensions (through the Extensions Manager, in 
the Control Panels folder). You will need to restart your computer for changes 
to take effect.
3. Insert the Glenn Gould: The New Listener CD into your CD-ROM drive.
4. If you do not already have QuickTime 3.0.2 installed: Double-click on the 
CD-ROM (GOULD). Locate a folder called QuickTime. Open this folder and double-
click on the Installer. Once you have installed QuickTime 3.0.2, you must 
restart your computer for changes to take effect.
5. Minimum installation: Copy the folder called Place on Hard Drive (15 MB) to 
your hard drive. Recommended installation: If you have more than 620 MB of hard 
drive space available, drag the entire GOULD CD-ROM onto your hard drive.

III. Troubleshooting the Operating System

A. Windows
1. Memory Tips
Windows 95 makes extensive use of virtual memory. (Virtual memory allows Windows 
to use hard disk space to save information to the disk rather than keeping it in 
RAM during all operations.  It should be turned on, with the default setting 
allowing Windows to manage the memory--this is the suggested mode for the 
Operating System.) If The New Listener is not performing well, check to ensure 
you have enough hard drive space available for virtual memory to work properly.  
Generally speaking, the more contiguous the hard drive space available, the 
faster virtual memory will work.

You can tell how much hard drive space is available on your computer by right-
clicking the hard drive, commonly labelled as the C: drive.  If there are only a 
few megabytes of hard drive space available, you may need to create more hard 
drive space for Windows 95 to operate efficiently and for The New Listener to 
perform as designed.

It is also recommended that you occassionally use ScanDisk to make sure that 
there are no problems with the disc medium.  Under the Start Menu, you can 
locate ScanDisk in Accessories, under System Tools.

It is also recommended that you use Defragmenter to optimize files on the hard 
drive as part of your regular PC maintenance plan.  This will make all disc 
related operations work faster.

2. The New Listener has been optimized for the High colour (16-bit) or True 
colour (24-bit) monitor setting, using a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels. In the 
Control Panels, double-click Display Control Panel and make the necessary 
adjustments. You may need to restart your PC for changes to take effect.

3. Make sure all applications are closed. Any applications running in the 
background may result in decreased performance.

4. If The New Listener is not responsive, quit the application, reboot your PC 
and begin again. Do not double-click The New Listener icon more than once. It 
may take a few seconds to begin working; if the application is double-clicked 
more than once, you will start up a second copy of the program, and 
unpredictable performance may result.

5. Windows Drivers
You must install all the drivers included with The New Listener. If any of the 
drivers are not installed, not all functionality will be accessible, or the 
program might seem to malfunction. The New Listener will install Intel's RSX 
driver, Microsoft's DirectX drivers, and Apple's Quicktime 3.0.2. If all the 
drivers have not been loaded properly, you can re-install any of the drivers by 
double-clicking on setup.exe located at the root directory on the GOULD CD-ROM.

You can check to see if Quicktime 3.0.2 has properly loaded by opening the 
Control Panels and locating the Quicktime control panel. 

The Intel RSX drivers will install a program group in the Start Menu, located in 
INTEL RSX 3D. You can test the RSX drivers by using RSX configuration. If it is 
not working properly, please uninstall the software and reinstall it. To 
uninstall, click on the Add/Remove Programs control panel in the Control Panels.

Microsoft DirectX technologies can be added/removed via the same Add/Remove 
Program Control Panel. DirectX will appear in the list of installed programs if 
it has properly been installed. The New Listener requires DirectX 5.0 or later. 


B. Macintosh
1. Memory Tips
The New Listener may perform better if the main program is provided with more 
memory. Memory settings have been preset to accommodate a typically configured 
computer with at least 10 MB of free memory (RAM). To obtain good performance 
from The New Listener, this amount of RAM should be sufficient. However, to 
speed up performance (provided you have more than 10 MB of available RAM), we 
recommend that you increase the Preferred Memory setting of The New Listener 
file which is now on your desktop.

To increase the Preferred Memory setting of The New Listener, select its icon, 
and choose Get Info from the File menu, or press < command + i >. You will call 
up a dialogue box, within which you may set Preferred Memory to any amount of 
RAM you choose. Close the dialogue box before you start up the CD-ROM.

2. Monitor Colour Depth for Video and Graphics Tips
In the Monitors control panel, you may set your monitor resolution to 640 by 480 
pixels, and a colour depth of thousands or millions of colours for optimum 
performance.

3. Background Applications, Control Panels, Extensions
a. Turn off all unnecessary extensions and memory enhancement products such as 
RAM Doubler. To do this, go to your Extensions Manager control panel. Refer to 
your computer's manual for more information.
b. If you use Virtual Memory, turn it off in the Memory control panel of your 
computer, or adjust it for the lowest setting. Refer to your computer's manual 
for more information.
c. If you adjust your extensions or Virtual Memory settings, you will need to 
restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
d. Make sure your computer's sound is ON.
e. Close all other applications.
f. The New Listener uses standard fonts that come pre-installed with your system 
software. For the text to display correctly, these fonts must be installed.

V. Guide to Easier Navigation of The New Listener CD-ROM
WARNING: Do not read this section if you wish to EXPLORE and DISCOVER The New 
Listener on your own. It is suggested that you return to part of the Read Me 
only after spending some time with the CD-ROM, as many of the CD-ROM's secrets 
are here.

A. The Title Screen
The title screen provides you with a number of settings and options. Here you 
may adjust the CD-ROM's volume using the dial placed in the centre top of the 
screen. You may enter the interactive Northern Landscape by clicking on the 
image of the piano pedals, and the Database by clicking on the button at the top 
right of the screen. You may look at the credits and exit the CD-ROM by clicking 
on the button at the top left of the screen. Alternatively, you may quit the CD-
ROM from any section by typing “q” (without the quotation marks) on the keyboard 
for both Windows and the Macintosh.

B. The Interactive Environments
Please note: the Interactive portion of the project (contained within the 
Northern Landscape) uses a type of navigation and mouse movement which is 
similar to playing a musical instrument. The cursor often becomes one with the 
image, providing you with the creative task of "playing" the mouse and 
interface.

Before entering any of the environments, practice scrolling left and right on 
the horizon of the Main Menu, moving faster towards the edges of the screen, 
slower towards the centre, and stopping when the image within the frame (and the 
compass pointer at the bottom of the interface) appears brightest. 

1. From the Title Screen: Enter the interactive Northern Landscape by clicking 
on the rectangular image of the piano pedals.

2. From the Northern Landscape, move your mouse left or right. You'll find that 
the further to the edges you move, the faster the horizon will spin "around" 
you. When you see the rectangular frames, you'll notice that certain iconic 
images will appear. When each image is at its most saturated, that is the time 
to click and enter that space. You'll find entry points into The Idea of North, 
The Car, The Cottage/Apartment, The Auditorium/Studio and The Church. In order 
to enter the Sea of Phones, position your mouse so there is no movement on the 
horizon. Click your mouse button when you see the telephone scurrying into the 
landscape.

3. In order to move into a different environment, you must return to the 
Northern Landscape (main menu, with the compass, blowing clouds, and moving 
horizon). Find the circular indentation and click on it. If you are in the 
Editing Suite or the Microphone Perspective areas, you must stop playback before 
you can leave these sections.

4. Further Hints for Each of the Environments
a. Mountain: Here you can move into the left or the right side of the rock 
"cavern". To the left you'll encounter the Studio, with the "alternate mix" 
interactive using Bach's Fugue in A Minor from The Well-Tempered Clavier; to the 
right is the Stage, with Sibelius' "acoustic choreography" interactive.
i/ Upon entering the Studio, you can listen to Gould's original version of 
Bach's Fugue in A Minor. Remove the rocks from the stacked pile if you wish to 
begin experimenting with your own edit. The four separate piles represent four 
different studio takes, while the rocks in each pile represent splices, from 
largest (Splice 1) to smallest (Splice 6). Preview each take and splice by 
placing the corresponding rock in the indented rockface. Once you've previewed 
each take, place your selection in the centre snowdrift, and continue mixing and 
matching until you have a version of the Fugue you'd like to listen to.
ii/ The Stage will begin by introducing Glenn Gould's own perspective on the 
Sibelius recording. You can skip this at any time by clicking on the movie 
window during playback. Next, you can listen to Gould's original version of the 
Sonatine mixed for public release. At any time, you can start playing about with 
your own version by clicking and dragging the mouse across each of the four 
pairs of hands. The closest (left) set of hands mirrors the closest perspective; 
the furthest set of hands (right) represents the most ambient perspective. 
Clicking and dragging the mouse to the left decreases that microphone's volume 
and if you move toward the right, it increases the volume. This section is best 
experienced with stereo headphones.

b. The Idea of North interactive is a participant-controlled mix. By panning to 
the left or right, you will encounter the characters of Marianne Schroeder, 
R.A.J. Phillips and Frank Vallee. By moving toward the character ("upwards" 
toward the horizon) you will increase that character's speaking volume; and 
conversely, you will decrease that character's volume by moving "downwards" or 
away from the horizon. If you allow your cursor to idle (i.e. if you leave your 
mouse to sit for a fixed period of time), each character will start to walk 
towards you yet away from you at the same time.

c. The Cottage/Apartment: Your mouse will control one of the two overlapped 
images on the screen. Slowly manoeuver the top layer to align: i/ the painting 
on the left; ii/ the painting in the middle; iii/ the lamp on the right. Click 
your mouse button when the images are matched. Each alignment will lead to a 
different part of the Cottage/Apartment.

i/ The painting on the left leads to one side of the cottage. Move the multi-
dimensional wall and beyond that, walk through the memories of Gould at the 
cottage, as both child and adult. Don't forget to click on each image - you 
might find a surprise or two waiting for you.

ii/ The painting in the middle leads to a collage of imagery and sound that 
might resemble some of the visual and aural sensations that Gould would have had 
during his retreats at the cottage. Use your mouse to gather the little bits of 
musical notation and move from side to side. Click when the notation lights up 
and watch the impressions unfold.

iii/ The lamp to the right leads to The Apartment. In this section of the 
environment, you'll find doorways leading to Gould's archival room, another area 
of keepsakes, the piano in the desert story, as well as others. Let your 
imagination roam as you open drawers, playfully place discs on Gould's Grammy 
Award gramophone, pull at shelves and piles of "stuff", wipe away layers of dust 
and accumulations of time, and uncover some of the private Gould. But be 
forwarned, just as in real life, you may not be able to access everything!

d. The Car: Press on the glove box latch to open this compartment. Inside you'll 
find a number of Polaroid snapshots, and when you rifle through them, they will 
reassemble themselves right in front of your eyes. Click once to select a 
snapshot, and watch and listen for the various associations triggered by Gould 
and his relationship to technology and urban Toronto. Look for the map, the 
radio, the photo stills with a contrapuntal soundtrack of Gould, the video of 
Gould talking about Yonge Street, and the Gould driving experience.

e. The Church: Use your mouse to reveal, illuminate and explore different areas 
of the church interior. You'll find some of the mysterious elements that taken 
together, form part of the spiritual essence of Glenn Gould. In the portal on 
the left is the organ chamber. Examine the stained glass to reveal why Gould 
loved the church. From the main chamber, the portal on the right leads to 
Gould's famous chair, the support which his father built. In the central chamber 
flow more of Gould's memories and beliefs, about the institution, philosophy and 
fostering of music as a lifelong passion.

B. The Database
1. From the Title Screen: Click on the top right button to enter the Database.

2. From the Northern Landscape: In order to leave any of the interactive modules 
and jump over to the Database, you must return to the Northern Landscape (main 
menu, with the compass, blowing clouds, and moving horizon). Find the circular 
indentation and click on it. If you are in the Editing Suite or the Microphone 
Perspective areas, you must stop playback before you can leave these sections. 
Once you've returned to the main menu, you can move your cursor to the top of 
the screen and click on the appropriate button to enter the Database.

3. The control buttons for the Database are as follows. In the grey rectangular 
Control Panel, you can choose one of four media areas, separated into four 
quadrants. Clicking on the top left quadrant (the violet triangle) will take you 
to Images and Documents, the top right will take you to Audio and Video, the 
bottom left will yield Concepts, References and Anecdotes, and the bottom right 
will show the Discography. In each media window, the blue buttons will allow you 
to page through, or play and stop the playback, corresponding to the type of 
media you are looking at.

4. There are two ways to browse the Glenn Gould Database. You can choose them by 
clicking on the blue button on the Control Panel. 

a. Table of Contents lists predetermined subjects. Clicking on any of the Table 
of Contents subheadings accesses elements associated with that subject.

b. Search allows you to search the database for specific information. You can 
choose Search by Description or Search by Keyword. Neither search is case-
sensitive (i.e., it will make no difference if you type your search terms in 
lower-case or CAPITAL letters). 

i/ If you choose to Search by Keyword, the Database will look for items exactly 
matching the word(s) you have typed in. You may also type in a year as a 
Keyword. A Keyword can be more than one word, but the Database will look for an 
exact match. 

It is easier to search for ideas and/or concepts using the Keyword search. You 
may find variable results depending upon the use of singular or plural 
keyword(s), and the order in which the keywords are typed in. Some examples of 
typical keyword entries are (without the quotation marks) "1959 European 
concerts", "Musical philosophy", "Early recitals", "Idea of North", etc. Some 
items may contain keywords that have many synonyms; if your search results are 
not satisfactory, try replacing words with ones that have similar meanings. An 
example: try the word (without quotation marks) "recordings" instead of 
"records" or "albums", or try the word "scores" instead of "manuscripts". 

ii/ Search by Description combs through all of the text associated with the four 
categories of items. The database will display any records that contain all of 
the words in your search string. The results from this search will generally be 
broader than those of the Keyword search. 

You can search all the media panes at once (Global Search), or choose to search 
one (or more) of the media panels. You can turn on the onscreen Help for more 
information at any time by clicking the  ?  at the bottom left of the interface.

Use the Database and the concepts you discover there to inform your re-entries 
into the interactive landscape.

5. In order to leave the Database and return to the main menu, click once on the 
coloured panorama (narrow rectangular area) beside the grey control panel.
